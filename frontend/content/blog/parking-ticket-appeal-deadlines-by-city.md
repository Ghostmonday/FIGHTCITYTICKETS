# Parking Ticket Appeal Deadlines: A Complete List by City

Missing the deadline is the most common reason appeals are rejected. Here's a comprehensive guide to appeal deadlines across major US cities.

## Why Deadlines Matter

Cities strictly enforce appeal deadlines because:
- Evidence degrades over time
- Administrative efficiency requires timely processing
- Legal precedents require consistent deadlines

Once missed, your options become very limited.
