# How to Fight a Parking Ticket in San Francisco

Getting a parking ticket in San Francisco is frustrating. The fines add up quickly, and the process of appealing can seem overwhelming. But you have rights, and the appeals process exists for a reason.

## Understanding Your Citation

Before you start the appeal process, gather all the information from your ticket:

- **Citation number** (9 digits, starts with 9)
- **Violation date and time**
- **Location where the ticket was issued**
- **Vehicle license plate number**

## Check the Deadline

In San Francisco, you have **21 days** from the date of the ticket to request an administrative review. This deadline is strict - late appeals are typically rejected.

## Common Grounds for Appeal

While we can't provide legal advice, here are procedural issues that sometimes lead to ticket dismissal:

### 1. Sign Visibility

California Vehicle Code requires parking restriction signs to be clearly visible. If a sign was:

- Obstructed by vegetation
- Faded or damaged
- Not properly installed

This could be grounds for appeal.

### 2. Meter Issues

If your meter showed valid time when the ticket was written, or if the meter itself was malfunctioning, document this with photos and timestamped evidence.

### 3. Permit Display

If you had a valid permit but it wasn't visible for some reason (it fell, was obscured, etc.), this may be relevant to your appeal.

## The Appeal Process

### Step 1: Gather Evidence

Take photos of:

- The location where you parked
- Any relevant signs
- Your meter or permit (if applicable)
- The ticket itself

### Step 2: Write Your Statement

Describe what happened clearly and factually. Focus on:

- What you observed
- What you did
- Any relevant circumstances

### Step 3: Submit Your Appeal

Use our automated service to:

- Format your appeal letter properly
- Submit via certified mail with tracking
- Ensure delivery confirmation

## What Happens Next

After submission:

1. The SFMTA will review your appeal (typically 4-6 weeks)
2. You'll receive a written decision by mail
3. If denied, you may request a hearing

## Tips for Success

- **Be factual** - Stick to what you know, not speculation
- **Be concise** - Clear, brief statements are more effective
- **Be timely** - Don't wait until the last minute
- **Keep records** - Save copies of everything
