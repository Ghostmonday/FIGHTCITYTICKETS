How to Fight a Parking Ticket in San Francisco,how-to-fight-parking-ticket-san-francisco,"Getting a parking ticket in San Francisco is frustrating. The fines add up quickly, and the process of appealing can seem overwhelming. But you have rights, and the appeals process exists for a reason.

## Understanding Your Citation

Before you start the appeal process, gather all the information from your ticket:

- Citation number (9 digits, starts with 9)
- Violation date and time
- Location where the ticket was issued
- Vehicle license plate number

## Check the Deadline

In San Francisco, you have 21 days from the date of the ticket to request an administrative review. This deadline is strict - late appeals are typically rejected.

## Common Grounds for Appeal

While we can't provide legal advice, here are procedural issues that sometimes lead to ticket dismissal:

### 1. Sign Visibility
California Vehicle Code requires parking restriction signs to be clearly visible. If a sign was obstructed by vegetation, faded or damaged, or not properly installed, this could be grounds for appeal.

### 2. Meter Issues
If your meter showed valid time when the ticket was written, or if the meter itself was malfunctioning, document this with photos and timestamped evidence.

### 3. Permit Display
If you had a valid permit but it wasn't visible for some reason, this may be relevant to your appeal.

## The Appeal Process

### Step 1: Gather Evidence
Take photos of the location where you parked, any relevant signs, your meter or permit, and the ticket itself.

### Step 2: Write Your Statement
Describe what happened clearly and factually. Focus on what you observed, what you did, and any relevant circumstances.

### Step 3: Submit Your Appeal
Use our automated service to format your appeal letter properly and submit via certified mail with tracking.

## What Happens Next

After submission, the SFMTA will review your appeal (typically 4-6 weeks). You'll receive a written decision by mail. If denied, you may request a hearing.

## Tips for Success

- Be factual - Stick to what you know, not speculation
- Be concise - Clear, brief statements are more effective
- Be timely - Don't wait until the last minute
- Keep records - Save copies of everything"
