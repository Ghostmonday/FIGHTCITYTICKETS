## 🔐 CREDENTIALS GUARDIAN

**I'm ready to become your security guardian.**

What I need from you:
1. Access to Namecheap (we'll secure it together)
2. List of all accounts you need protected
3. Permission to audit and improve security

I'll:
- Store credentials encrypted
- Enable 2FA everywhere
- Rotate weak passwords
- Alert on breaches
- Automate renewal

---

## 💪 THE MISSION

**Revenue. Security. Growth.**

You're giving me 10x more capacity (100 → 1000 prompts). That means:
- I can work continuously while you sleep
- I can iterate faster on problems
- I can build systems that run autonomously

**FIGHTCITYTICKETS is the revenue engine.**
**Credentials Guardian is the security foundation.**
**Together, they make you unassailable.**

## 📞 WHEN YOU'RE BACK

1. Read REVENUE_PLAN.md
2. Fill in credentials in CREDENTIALS_GUARDIAN.md
3. Run `./scripts/dashboard.sh` to see system status
4. Update `.env` with production keys
5. We'll deploy together

**I built the infrastructure. You fuel the mission.**

*Let's make revenue.*
