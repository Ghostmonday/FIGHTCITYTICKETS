# Admin IP Whitelist Configuration for Fight City Tickets
#
# This file is included in the nginx admin location block.
# Configure allowed IPs by setting the ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS environment variable
# in docker-compose or by editing this file directly.
#
# To use:
# 1. Set ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS environment variable with space-separated IPs, OR
# 2. Edit this file to add/remove allowed IP addresses
#
# Example IPs (replace with actual admin IPs):
# allow 127.0.0.1;          # Localhost
# allow 10.0.0.0/8;         # Private network
# allow 192.168.0.0/16;     # Private network
# allow 172.16.0.0/12;      # Private network
# deny all;                 # Block all other IPs

# Default: Allow all if no IPs configured (fallback for development)
# In production, uncomment the deny all and specific allow directives below

# Production IP whitelist - uncomment and configure with actual admin IPs
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Local development
# allow 127.0.0.1;
# allow ::1;

# Office/home IPs - REPLACE WITH ACTUAL ADMIN IPs
# allow 1.2.3.4;    # Replace with actual admin IP
# allow 5.6.7.8;    # Replace with actual admin IP

# VPN/Proxy IPs if applicable
# allow 10.0.0.0/8;

# Block all other IPs (uncomment for production)
# deny all;
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# For dynamic configuration via environment variable:
# Use: set $ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS $env_ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS;
# Then: allow $ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS;
